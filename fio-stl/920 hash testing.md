## Hash Function Testing

During development I tested the Hash functions using [the SMHasher testing suite (@rurban's fork)](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher). The testing suite is often growing with more tests, so I do not know what the future may bring... but attached are the test results for Risky Hash, Stable Hash (64 and 128 bit variation) as they were at the time of (re)development (March, 2023).
