## URL (URI) parsing

```c
#define FIO_URL
#include "fio-stl.h"
```

URIs (Universal Resource Identifier), commonly referred to as URL (Uniform Resource Locator), are a common way to describe network and file addresses.

A common use case for URIs is within the command line interface (CLI), allowing a client to point at a resource that may be local (i.e., `file:///users/etc/my.conf`) or remote (i.e. `http://example.com/conf`).

By defining `FIO_URL`, the following types and functions will be defined:

#### `fio_url_s`

```c
/** the result returned by `fio_url_parse` */
typedef struct {
  fio_buf_info_s scheme;
  fio_buf_info_s user;
  fio_buf_info_s password;
  fio_buf_info_s host;
  fio_buf_info_s port;
  fio_buf_info_s path;
  fio_buf_info_s query;
  fio_buf_info_s target;
} fio_url_s;
```

The `fio_url_s` contains a information about a URL (or, URI).

When the information is returned from `fio_url_parse`, the strings in the `fio_url_s` (i.e., `url.scheme.buf`) are **not NUL terminated**, since the parser is non-destructive, with zero-copy and zero-allocation.

#### `fio_buf_info_s` - revisited

The `fio_buf_info_s` is used to return information about the parts of the URL's string buffers detailed above. Since the `fio_url_s` does not return NUL terminated strings, this returned data structure is used.

```c
typedef struct fio_buf_info_s {
  /** The buffer's address (may be NULL if no buffer). */
  char *buf;
  /** The buffer's length, if any. */
  size_t len;
} fio_buf_info_s;
```

See [Binary Data Informational Types and Helpers](#binary-data-informational-types-and-helpers) for more details.

#### `fio_url_parse`

```c
fio_url_s fio_url_parse(const char *url, size_t len);
```

Parses the URI returning it's components and their lengths (no decoding performed, **doesn't accept decoded URIs**).

The returned string are **not NUL terminated**, they are merely locations within the original (unmodified) string.

This function attempts to accept many different formats, including any of the following:

* `/complete_path?query#target`

  i.e.: `/index.html?page=1#list`

* `host:port/complete_path?query#target`

  i.e.:
  - `example.com`
  - `example.com:8080`
  - `example.com/index.html`
  - `example.com:8080/index.html`
  - `example.com:8080/index.html?key=val#target`

* `user:password@host:port/path?query#target`

  i.e.: `user:1234@example.com:8080/index.html`

* `username[:password]@host[:port][...]`

  i.e.: `john:1234@example.com`

* `schema://user:password@host:port/path?query#target`

  i.e.: `http://example.com/index.html?page=1#list`

* `file://some/path`

  i.e.: `file://./relative/path`
  i.e.: `file:///absolute/path`

Invalid formats might produce unexpected results. No error testing performed.

The `file`, `unix` and `priv` schemas are special in the sense that they produce no `host` (only `path`) and are parsed as if they contain file path information.
